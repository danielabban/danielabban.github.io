      <description>Identifying Questions Pairs with Same Intent At Quora, an important product principle is that there should be a single question page for each logically distinct question. For example, the queries “What is the most populous state in the USA?” and “Which state in the United States has the most people?” should not exist separately on Quora because the intent behind both is identical. We are provided with a list of question pairs and our task is to identify duplicate questions based on previous results.</description>

      <description>Most companies would love to keep their valuable employees for a very long period of time, unfortunately this is not the case. Many employees walk off the door with very short or no notice, surpervisors are also not able to quickly anticipate these actions to revert them.
If employers can anticipate employees desire to leave, they would be better prepared to curb any negative outcome it would have on the company.</description>
